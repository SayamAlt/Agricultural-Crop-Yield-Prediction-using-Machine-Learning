üåæ Agricultural Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning in R

üöÄ Project Overview

Successfully developed a crop yield regression system using advanced machine learning algorithms in R. This project aims to predict crop yields (in tons per hectare) using agro-environmental, soil, and weather data. The solution includes a fully automated pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, designed for practical decision-making in agriculture.
